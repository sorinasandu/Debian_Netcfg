    - Remove XSIisms in dhclient-script.
    - Evaluate argv[0] after calling basename on it so that we can strcmp it
      against "ptom". It somehow didn't happen in the internal dhclient-script
      context, but appeared during testing in the shell.
    - Add Thomas Hood to Uploaders.
    - Re-enable broadcast stuff in dhclient-script, fixing a Sparc (at least)
      regression.
    - Remove kill_dhcp_client prototype from netcfg.h because it's now static.
    - Change newline + a space to just a newline to end some disable_dhcp
      woes.
    - Warn if there's no default route available after getting a DHCP lease.
      (Closes: #253543)
    - Don't add 'auto' or hotplug mapping lines for 16-bit PCMCIA devices.

  * Christian Perrier

      Some rewrite for being clearer, possibly. Run debconf-updatepo
  * Thomas Hood
    - Change interfaces options that use underscore to hyphens. No loss
      of functionality. (Closes: #255185)

      + Test for NULL pointers before using empty_str()
    - netcfg.c, netcfg-dhcp.c, netcfg-static.c
      + Handle the case where there are no interfaces.  Just ask for a
        hostname and write basic /etc/network/interfaces and /etc/hosts
        files.  (Closes: #243543)
    - netcfg-common.c:
      + netcfg_get_interface(): Don't exit if there are no interfaces.
        Instead just return with variables set to 0.

      + Add comments to /e/n/i about which packages implement which options
      + Fix race to dhcp_exit_status after dhcp_running set to 0.
      + Count iterations in the polling loop instead of checking the time()
      + Use waitpid(dhcp_pid,,) instead of wait() to get child status
        since we don't want the status of, e.g., killall.sh
      + Eliminate use of dhcp_running and use (dhcp_pid>0) in its place
      + Eliminate some unnecessary calls to kill_dhcp_client()
      + Mark local variables with "static"
      + Eliminate use of quit_after_hostname by creating HOSTNAME_SANS_NETWORK
        from HOSTNAME and DOMAIN_SANS_NETWORK from DOMAIN
      + Use DHCP hostname as the default hostname if no hostname is set
        (Closes: #239591)
      + Write hostname provided to the DHCP client in order to get a lease
        on the "hostname" option line for the interface in /e/n/i
      + If the user backs up from netcfg/get_hostname, go to retry question
      + Wait at least two seconds for DHCP client to exit  (Closes: #255984)
      + Clean up code
        . Always use spaces for indentation

    - Brown paper bag upload.
    - Add the netcfg/disable_dhcp template, default to false.
    - usleep(1500) actually sleeps for 1500 _micro_seconds, not milliseconds.

  * Joshua Kwan

    - killall.sh: add grep -v grep (Closes: #253099)
    - Allow netcfg/disable_dhcp option that governs what use_dhcp is
      set to every time we start, instead of hardcoding true. Defaults
      to true, so default behavior has not changed. (Closes: #248147)
    - Fix /etc/hosts writing after much deliberation. (Closes: #247734)
    - Use a static buffer for mii-diag call.
    - Sleep for 1.5 seconds before mii-diag, because slow network cards
      just take that long to answer. And for those that take more that's
      just too bad.

  * Joshua Kwan
    - When we get a hostname from DHCP, seed the domain name with whatever
      was received.
    - Rework is_hotpluggable_iface a tad.
    - Fix problem where broadcast address was being used twice.. only on
      some architectures, due to code with unspecified behavior.
    - Excise our dynamic prebaseconfig system and replace with a static one
      that copies all available files into /target.
    - For this, make sure we always start with a clean slate by removing
      those files at startup.
    - Move a bunch of static strings to the header file.

  * The "we love bugfixes that make new bugs" release.
  * Per Olofsson
    - Fixed segfault in find_in_devnames when a card was missing a devnames
      entry.
  * Joshua Kwan
    - Add a NETCFG_VERSION thingy so it's easier to figure out who's using
      what.
    - Don't reset the hostname to 'debian' on a failed seed from DNS.
    - Write resolv.conf and nothing else before preliminary activation
      for static configuration. This fixes the overwriting of static-specific
      interface entries with the common (lo) entry.

      domain name.
    - DHCP server is not required to supply a domain name. (Closes: #250021)
    - Switch to using mii-diag-udeb instead of mii-lite.c, which doesn't
      seem to work across the board. (also addresses #250074)
    - In static configuration, if the IP address specified turns out to be
      the same as what we suggest for the gateway, nuke the last part of
      the dotted quad because gateway == IP makes no sense. (Closes: #241490)

netcfg (0.64) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Joshua Kwan
    - Split out all functions into static.c, dhcp.c, wireless.c.
    - Remove dep alternative to busybox-cvs-udeb etc., since udhcpc is no
      longer available in any initrd. This causes businesscard and netinst
      installs to fail because busybox is already provided and hence gets
      used.
    - Remove udhcpc support in dhcp.c.
    - Port wireless fixes back to netcfg-static and netcfg-dhcp, which
      have been rather neglected lately.
    - Fix the GO_BACK interaction between WEP and ESSID configuration.
    - Switch to using iproute for everything, a step towards removing
      ifconfig and route applets from busybox.
    - Add amd64 support. (Closes: #249363)
    - Open one set of socket FDs and use them for the whole runtime.
    - Write loopback all the time, even when you abort network config.
      (Closes: #248636)
    - Redesign DHCP strategy with a new template that uses a select,
      allowing the user to clearly alternate to static network config
      (Closes: #244901, #227722)
    - Display a brief note when DHCP lease gets acquired. (Closes: #247751)
    - Now we can ask for a DHCP hostname to add. (Closes: #236533, #239591)
    - If we didn't use one, see if the server is offering us one and seed
      netcfg/get_hostname with it. (Closes: #239121, #240701)
    - Failing that, bring the interface up and try to reverse-resolve
      the IP address into a hostname.
    - For idempotency reasons, down all interfaces after finding each
      one so that we can start from a clean slate. (Probably deals with
      Bug#227722)
    - Silently load af_packet. (Closes: #244441)
    - Add some code hunks from mii-diag to determine code path on link
      connection. (Closes: #247178)
    - Add some interface_up and interface_down functions.
    - Fix a long standing bug in devnames retrieval that did not strip
      newlines from the devnames input and caused cdebconf to screw
      up on subsequent questions.
    - Bump the DHCP wait to 15 seconds. The magic number seems to be just
      over 10 for me. (Closes: #244819)
    - Template cleanups: netcfg/static-title, netcfg/dhcp-title,
      netcfg/internal-pcmcia, netcfg/confirm_dhcp
    - Add dhcp3-client support. Not that it actually gets used now that
      we can get a DHCP-supplied hostname from dhcp-client.
    - Remove a lot of calls to /sbin/this and /sbin/that in response to Joey's
      rant on debian-boot.

    - Use inet_pton and inet_ntop. Why must people always write their own
      instead of using well tested standard functions?
    - Only recalculate gateway if ipaddress or netmask is changed.
    - Never recalculate nameserver.
  * Joshua Kwan
    - Make the question about adhoc/managed actually do something,
      add a template for its question. Note: needs translation.
    - Make interfaces honor the decision made in the adhoc/managed question.
    - Make sure the WEP question, priority high, always gets asked.
    - No gateway, no point-to-point address is OK. (Closes: #238653)
    - If netcfg/get_hostname returns a FQDN, seed netcfg/get_domain with it
      and do not ask that question a second time. Only ask it if FQDN was
      _not_ passed. (Closes: #174360)
    - Write out some informative text to INTERFACES_FILE.
