  * Appease -Wunused-but-set-variable warning.
  * Fix fd leak in ethtool-lite.
  * Fix file handle leak in no_default_route's Hurd case.
  * Assign NETCFG_VERSION and NETCFG_BUILD_DATE using := rather than =; this
    is more efficient, and also avoids inconsistent build times being
    reported in the case where the build crossed a minute boundary.
  * Rearrange BOOTIF handling to allow us to handle the case where
    netcfg/choose_interface is preseeded with an Ethernet hardware address
    (LP: #708908).  The latter case should work on kFreeBSD as well.
  * Also release lease at end of install when using isc-dhcp-client.
  * Merge from Ubuntu:
    - Call /usr/lib/NetworkManager/ifblacklist_migrate.sh from
      finish-install if present, so that 'auto dhcp' interfaces are disabled
      if network-manager is in use.  May be preseeded away with
      netcfg/network-manager.  (Thanks, Matt Palmer; closes: #614884.)

  [ Wouter Verhelst ]

  * If there is no permanent IP address with which the system hostname
    (i.e., that which is returned by the "hostname" command) can be
    associated in /etc/hosts then associate it with address 127.0.1.1
    rather than 127.0.0.1.  Associating the system hostname with the
    latter had the unwanted effect of making 'localhost.localdomain'
    the canonical hostname associated with the system hostname.
    That is, 'hostname --fqdn' returned 'localhost.localdomain'.
    (Closes: #316099)
    Programs that access local services at the IP address obtained by
    resolving the system hostname SHOULD NOT DO THIS, but those that
    do so will not be disappointed: most services that listen locally
    listen on all 127/8 addresses, not just on 127.0.0.1.

      is performed." Use getnameinfo() instead.

    - mii-diag support is back, but once again, as a function. Hopefully
      it works better than the old one. This time, it only chooses a
      default interface based on the first connected one it finds. It also
      prefers ethtool to MII.
    - Also add a rudimentary wireless link detection heuristic to go with
      the new ethtool support.
    - Apply Andrew Pollock's WEP key patch. Thanks!
  * Thomas Hood
    - Use "wireless-key1" option in /e/n/i rather than "wireless-key"
      since the former allows the key string to contain whitespace
      whereas the latter does not.  (Closes: #271978)

    - Add Thomas Hood to Uploaders.
    - Re-enable broadcast stuff in dhclient-script, fixing a Sparc (at least)

    - Remove kill_dhcp_client prototype from netcfg.h because it's now static.

    - Remove udhcpc support in dhcp.c.

      have been rather neglected lately.
    - Fix the GO_BACK interaction between WEP and ESSID configuration.

    - If we didn't use one, see if the server is offering us one and seed
      netcfg/get_hostname with it. (Closes: #239121, #240701)
    - Failing that, bring the interface up and try to reverse-resolve
      the IP address into a hostname.
    - For idempotency reasons, down all interfaces after finding each
      one so that we can start from a clean slate. (Probably deals with
      Bug#227722)
    - Silently load af_packet. (Closes: #244441)
    - Add some code hunks from mii-diag to determine code path on link
      connection. (Closes: #247178)
    - Add some interface_up and interface_down functions.
    - Fix a long standing bug in devnames retrieval that did not strip
      newlines from the devnames input and caused cdebconf to screw
      up on subsequent questions.
    - Bump the DHCP wait to 15 seconds. The magic number seems to be just
      over 10 for me. (Closes: #244819)
    - Template cleanups: netcfg/static-title, netcfg/dhcp-title,
      netcfg/internal-pcmcia, netcfg/confirm_dhcp
    - Add dhcp3-client support. Not that it actually gets used now that
      we can get a DHCP-supplied hostname from dhcp-client.
    - Remove a lot of calls to /sbin/this and /sbin/that in response to Joey's
      rant on debian-boot.
